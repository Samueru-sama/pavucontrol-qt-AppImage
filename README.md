# pavucontrol-qt-AppImage

Imma be honest here, I made this because pavucontrol updated to gtk4 which has broken theming issues.

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend this alternative instead: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead.
